# Starting Out with Ember

Just me trying to follow along the [Peepcode Ember.js screencast](https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs) (which is excellent. You should get it).

# Development

Start the app by doing `yeoman server` from the root directory

# Troubleshooting

If you have SASS errors this might help:

```bash
gem uninstall sass
gem install sass --version 3.2.18 
```
